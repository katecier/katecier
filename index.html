            <p>Iceland is just how imagine it; unimaginable.  As you drive forward on the highway, mountains become glaciers, rivers become oceans, and grass fields become patches of weird, upstructing lava rocks.  The landscape is surely something you've never seen before.  The weather changes just as much as the landscape.  The sun shines until bedtime. </p>

                <p>Rent a <b>car</b>.  There are so many places to stop along the road that a tour bus would skip over.  Always wear your hiking boots, because the mountains are always calling. And don't forget to look up!</p>

                <p>The <b>weather</b> in Iceland is, well, cold.  If you plan to travel to Iceland during tourist season, you should be fine with packing relativiely lightly, but I reccommend going in the early season- pre tourists.  This way you're there for the end of Northern Lights season and the beginning of the glaciel melt.  This also means you must pack a parka and a hat- it can be fridgid and very, very windy. And the excess water from the millions of falls you'll see will only add to it. </p>
